# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
Transaction_React_APP is Responsive , Tailwind Used with it
repo:https://github.com/Ahmed-abdeldaiem/Transaction_React_App.git
Demo:https://transaction-react-app.vercel.app/
many libraries used as:
React Router DOM for Routing
axios for API
fontawesome for icons
generate-react-cli for creating files components
json-server to access and host db.json file 
react-spinners for loder
recharts for charts
formik for forms
Yup for validation
tailwindcss for design and responsive 



of course duo to nature of JSON server the change in client side only after deploy and hosting orders that use post and delete not do change in the hosting JSON file we can do operations normally but not show change in db file , so i give you this drive copy of code that copy of project on Drive you just follow this steps to run the code and test add and remove options locally 
1-open the file on Vscode 
2-open terminal and run npm i
2-in terminal also run ---> npm start 
NOTE: in this copy i use concurrently to run and watch the local JSON file on http://localhost:5000 together
